# **Section 1. Introduction **

- This workshop will cover the basics of Factor Analysis (both Exploratory and Confirmatory) in the R programming language

- Ideally for people with beginner/intermediate familiarity with R and/or interest in psychometrics / survey data analysis 

- About me: Data Scientist / Quantitative Social Scientist based in Los Angeles, California

- [Github](https://github.com/atreyagagan){target="blank"}

- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gagan-atreya-1170202a2/){target="blank"}

- [Email: atreyagagan@gmail.com](mailto:atreyagagan@gmail.com?){target="blank"}

## Data and code for this workshop 

- Github repo: Download all workshop contents from [here](https://github.com/atreyagagan/Factor_Analysis_R_Workshop){target="blank"}. 

![](../plots/gh_download.png){#id .class width=60% height=60%}

## Tasks today 

- This will be an applied workshop, with very little math/theory behind Factor Analysis

- Refer to the two readings (pdf files) in the github repo for more detailed disussions on the math behind EFA and CFA

- Rather, we will use an original dataset and go through the step-by-step of conducting Exploratory Data Analysis/Visualization, followed by Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and see how they differ practically. 

- Think of this as a guide that you can refer to later, more than a detailed discussion about the math behind FA/SEM etc. 


# **Section 2. Introduction to the data / EDA **

- Original cross-country survey conducted across four countries:

- Gambia, Pakistan, Tanzania, Uganda

- We will examine what people think about how "group leaders" should behave 

- We will do this by reducing survey responses to coherent constructs or "factors"

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

## Clear R environment:
rm(list=ls())

## Set digit options:
options(digits = 2)

## Set the working directory
## Use the project directory (downloaded from GitHub) as the working directory:
## [This is going to be different depending on your system]:
setwd("~/Desktop/factor_analysis_R_workshop/")

## Install/load R libraries using the "pacman" R package:
## This is easier than library(package1), library(package2), etc..
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lavaan, vtable, 
               psych, scales, corrplot, 
               ggthemes, ggcharts, patchwork)

## Import the dataset that we will be using for the workshop:
ds <- read_csv("data/fa_dataset.csv", show_col_types = F)

## Briefly go over the dataset, variables, codebook, etc. 
# vtable(ds)

```

## **Demographic variables for EDA:**

- Country
- Age
- Gender
- Socio-economic status
- Religious affiliation
- Marital status
- Education

### Items:

### To what extent do you agree with the following statements? 
### (1- Strongly Disagree to 7- Strongly Agree)
  
### Good leaders should:

### Leadership item 01:
### Seek out opportunities to bridge social divisions with their opponents, enemies, opposition groups, or other relevant outgroups.

# Visualize with histogram using functions in R 
# We can use the same function for subsequent items

                     x_variable) {
  ggplot(data, 
         aes(x = !!sym(x_variable))) +

# Promote the interests of the communities and groups they belong to 
# even at the expense of other competing groups.
summary(ds$leadership06)
histfx01(ds, "leadership06")
histfx02(ds, "leadership06")

## Factor Analysis of group leadership endorsement ### 

## Create a "leadership" dataframe:
## Which has all 6 leadership items:
leadership <- cbind.data.frame(ds$leadership01, ds$leadership02, 
                               ds$leadership03, ds$leadership04, 
                               ds$leadership05, ds$leadership06)
names(leadership)

## Remove "ds$" from the column names:
names(leadership) <- sub('ds\\$', '', names(leadership))
names(leadership)

## Omit NA or missing values:
leadership <- na.omit(leadership)

## Examine correlation matrix:
mtx01 <- cor(leadership[, c(1:6)])

```

## Visualize correlation matrix:

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

corrplot(mtx01, 
         method = "number", 
         number.cex = 0.7,
         col=c("white", "darkred", "red",
               "darkgrey", "blue", "darkblue"))
```

##  Bartlett's test of sphericity:

- Examine if factor analysis is "appropriate"

- This test tells you the probability that at least some of the items are correlated. 

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}
cortest.bartlett(leadership)

```

- The test is statistically significant, suggesting that factor analysis is appropriate.


## Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy test

- KMO statistic ranges from 0 to 1, and indicates "the degree to which each variable in a set is predicted without error by the other variables". 

- Rule of thumb: overall MSO for the KMO test needs to be greater than 0.60 at least. Closer to 1 = better. 

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

KMO(r=cor(leadership))

```

- Based on the results (overall MSA = 0.69), factor analysis is appropriate.


## Parallel test

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

parallel <- fa.parallel(leadership)

```

Based on the scree plot, factor analysis with two factors is the most appropriate. 

We will proceed with promax rotation, which assumes that the items are inter-correlated (that is, not independent from each other).


## Two factor model:

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}
fit01 <- factanal(leadership, 2, rotation="promax")
fit01

```

p-value > 0.05 suggests that two factors is sufficient. 

We cannot reject the null hypothesis that two factors captures "full dimensionality" in the dataset

## Plot loadings for each factor

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

plot(
  fit01$loadings[, 1], 
  fit01$loadings[, 2],
  xlab = "Factor 1", 
  ylab = "Factor 2", 
  ylim = c(-1, 1),
  xlim = c(-1, 1),
  main = "Factor analysis of prostate data"
)
abline(h = 0, v = 0)

#add column names to each point
text(
  fit01$loadings[, 1] - 0.128, 
  fit01$loadings[, 2] + 0.128,
  colnames(leadership),
  col = "blue"
)

```


**We can observe a two factor structure **

Factor 1: leadership01, leadership02, leadership03

Factor 2: leadership04, leadership05, leadership06

Refer to codebook to see if these factors are "coherent"

Factor 01:

Item 1:
Seek out opportunities to bridge social divisions with their opponents, enemies, opposition groups, or other relevant outgroups.

Item 2:
Demonstrate willingness to compromise with their opponents, enemies, opposition groups, or other relevant outgroups. 

Item 3:
Try to understand and empathize with their opponents, enemies, pposition groups, or other relevant outgroups.  

Call this factor: **"Barrier Crossing Leadership"**

Factor 02:

Item 1:
Try to accurately represent the interests of the communities and groups that they belong to. 

item 2:
Seek out opportunities to build stronger connections within the communities and groups they belong to.

item 3:
Promote the interests of the communities and groups they belong to even at the expense of other competing groups.

Call this factor: **"Barrier bound leadership"**

## Interpreting EFA output:

The promax rotated FA output suggests that there are two factors:

- Factor 1 = Barrier Crossing Leadership (BCL). Made up of items 01, 02, 03

- Factor 2 = Barrier Bound Leadership (BBL) Made up of items 04, 05, 06. 

The two factors cumulatively explain 53% of the variance in the data. 

Factor 1 (BCL) explains 29% of the variance, Factor 2 (BBL) explains 24%


# **Section 4. Confirmatory Factor Analysis**

- Why CFA? 

- EFA: "letting the data guide you" 

- CFA: a priori theory based. 

- We have expectations about the number of factors, how the factor structures should look like, etc. 

- EFA: tells you how many factors to retain 

- CFA: you already know how many factors to retain, so you test how close your data fits with expectations

- CFA has its roots in Structural Equation Modeling, where we model "latent variables" 

- In practice, they are rarely different quantitatively. 


```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

## Create two factor structure:
twofacs <- 'BCL =~ leadership01+leadership02+leadership03
            BBL =~ leadership04+leadership05+leadership06' 

## Fit the model:
cfa01 <- cfa(twofacs, 
             data = leadership, 
             std.lv = TRUE) 

summary(cfa01,
        fit.measures = TRUE,
        standardized = TRUE)
```

## Interpreting lavaan CFA output
 
 - Model chi-square = 21.210, p < 0.05. 
 
 - **Comparative Fit Index (CFI)** = 0.994.
 - Fit statistic that ranges between 0 and 1.
 - Takes into account Model chi-square. 
 - In essence, you are comparing a "baseline" model with the model that you fit. 
 - Rule of thumb: CFI > 0.9 indicates good fit. 
 
 - **Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)** = 0.990 
 - Similar to CFI, but less sensitive to sample size. 
 - Takes into account relative chi-square (normalized chi square).
 - Rule of thumb: the closer to 1 means better. 
 
 - **Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)**
 - "Absolute" measure of fit. 
 - Rule of thumb:
 - RMSEA =< 0.05 indicates good fit. 
 - RMSEA >= 0.10 indicates poor fit. 

- Often the output can be messy, so we can take into account all the model fit statistics:

- p value of Model chi-square < 0.05. 
- CFI > 0.99
- TLI = 0.99
- RMSEA < 0.05

All of this indicates that our model is a good fit. We can reasonably conclude there are two factors or dimensions on how people judge leadership qualities in this data. 

# **Section 5. After Factor Analysis: Reliability Analysis and Visualization**

- We have established a two factor structure. Both EFA and CFA results suggest the same thing. 

- Now, we can examine the "reliability" or "internal validity" of the two constructs represented by the two factors.

- Does it measure what it says it measures?

- How well do the items go together? 

- How closely related are the set of items as a group?

- Different from "external validity" or "generalizability"

## Compute internal validity of BCL:

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

BCL <- cbind.data.frame(ds$leadership01, ds$leadership02, ds$leadership03)

alph01 <- psych::alpha(BCL)
alph01
summary(alph01)

```

## Compute internal validity of BBL:

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

BBL <- cbind.data.frame(ds$leadership04, ds$leadership05, ds$leadership06)
alph02 <- psych::alpha(BBL)
alph02
summary(alph02)

```

## Interpretation of reliability analysis output

- **Crohnbach's alpha:** 

- Closer to 1 is better. Minimum of 0.70, ideally greater than 0.80. 

- Sensitive to item numbers. More items means greater alpha. 

- **Reliability if an item is dropped:**

- How is the scale/construct affected if this item is dropped?

- **Item statistics:**

- Correlation between the item and the scale (item-total correlation)

- raw.r = raw correlation 
- r.drop = correlation with the scale after item is dropped
- r.cor = correlation taking into account overlap between item and scale and reliability
- ideally, item and scale should be correlated

## Visualize BCL/BBL

- We can also visualize the two constructs and how they differ across countries. 

## Compute internal validity of BBL:

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

## Create the actual construct, which is the average of three items:
ds$BCL <- (ds$leadership01+ds$leadership02+ds$leadership03)/3
ds$BBL <- (ds$leadership04+ds$leadership05+ds$leadership06)/3

## Visualize barrier crossing leadership:
summary(ds$BCL)
histfx01(ds, "BCL")
histfx02(ds, "BCL")

## Visualize barrier bound leadership:
summary(ds$BBL)
histfx01(ds, "BBL")
histfx02(ds, "BBL")

```

-  We can also examine how BCL and BBL vary by country and gender (or any other variable that we might be curious about)

```{r, error = F, message = F, warning = F}

bp02 <- ds %>% drop_na(BCL, BBL, gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = BCL, 
             x = country))+
geom_boxplot(fill = "grey")+
  labs(y = "BCL",
       x = "",
       title = "Endorsement of BCL by country")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

bp02

bp03 <- ds %>% drop_na(BCL, BBL, gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = BCL, 
             x = gender))+
geom_boxplot(fill = "grey")+
  labs(y = "BCL",
       x = "",
       title = "Gender differences in endorsement of BCL by country")+
  facet_wrap(~country, nrow = 2)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

bp03

bp04 <- ds %>% drop_na(BCL, BBL, gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = BBL, 
             x = country))+
geom_boxplot(fill = "grey")+
  labs(y = "BBL",
       x = "",
       title = "Endorsement of BBL by country")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

bp04

bp05 <- ds %>% drop_na(BCL, BBL, gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = BBL, 
             x = gender))+
geom_boxplot(fill = "grey")+
  labs(y = "BBL",
       x = "",
       title = "Gender differences in endorsement of BBL by country")+
  facet_wrap(~country, nrow = 2)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

# **Section 6. Conclusion **

In this workshop, we used original survey data on attitudes towards group leadership across four countries and conducted:

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

- Exploratory Factor Analysis 

- Confirmatory Factor Analysis

- Reliability Analysis 

- We can use the same general principles for other contexts where Factor Analysis (either EFA or CFA) can be used. 


# **Section 7. Exercise**

- This was a neat example where our factors lined up nicely. However, real world data can sometimes (often) be messy. 

- Use the "exercise" dataset which contains attitudes of Americans towards different groups 

- Conduct EFA 

- Justify the number of factors 

- Conduct CFA 

- Conduct Reliability Analysis and Visualization 

- Feel free to email me with questions/comments.
